# Test environment for JS+HTML Tremola miniapps, inside Chrome browser tabs

_Tremola_ is the (internal) name of the tinySSB Android app which is
written in Kotlin: it hosts "miniapps" i.e., bundles of JavaScript and
HTML, for games and similar functionality. In the past, each time a
change was made to a miniapp, it was necessary to recompile the whole
Android app in order to test it.

With this "tremola4chrome" repo we provide an emulation environment
for miniapps which does away with the recompilation: Tremola's "Kotlin
backend" is replaced by the messaging bus across Chrome browser tabs.
